# PropertyPulse - House Value Predictor

## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting house prices along with a simple web application for interacting with the model.

### Components
- `PricePredictionModel.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook that details the process of building and training the machine learning model for house price prediction.
- `SimpleUI.py`: Python script for a basic user interface to interact with the model.
- `models.py`: Defines the data models used in the application.
- `views.py`: Contains the view functions for the web application.
- `login.html`, `predict.html`, `result.html`: HTML templates for the login page, prediction input page, and the results display page, respectively.

## Price Prediction Model
The Jupyter Notebook (`PricePredictionModel.ipynb`) includes:
- Data importation and preprocessing.
- Exploratory data analysis.
- Model building and training using XGBoost.
- Evaluation and validation of the model.

## Web Application
The web application is built using Python and includes:
- `SimpleUI.py`: Script for running the web application.
- `models.py`: Contains the structure of the data models.
- `views.py`: Handles the request-response cycle for the web application.
- HTML Templates: 
    - `login.html`: Interface for user login.
    - `predict.html`: Form for inputting data to predict house prices.
    - `result.html`: Displays the prediction results.
